## Effective defense against port scanners

### Short description:

The portspoof program is designed to enhance OS security through emulation of legitimate service signatures on otherwise closed ports. 
It is meant to be a lightweight, fast, portable and secure addition to the any firewall system or security infrastructure.
The general goal of the program is to make the port scanning software (Nmap/Unicornscan/etc) process slow  and output very difficult to interpret, thus making the attack reconnaissance phase a challenging and bothersome task.
	 
###General benefits of using this software are:
* Protection against well known port scanners (all scanning results are chaotic and difficult to interpret)
* Possibility to use your current firewall rules to decide for which hosts "port spoofing" applies
* Port scanning detection functionality
* Lightweight and fast
